- title: "Implicit representation of algebraic rational 3D surfaces by means of syzygy-based methods"
  description: >
    Studied the implicit representation of rational algebraic curves and surfaces via syzygy-based matrices. 
    Studied several tools from algebraic geometry (e.g. basics on algebraic schemes, blowup maps), commutative algebra (e.g. Rees and Symmetric algebras).
    Implement the result into Macaulay2 code and develop a Macaulay2 Package for syzygy-based matrices of algebraic curves and surfaces.
    Look at the open problem of cases for which the formalism does not allow to conclude the validity of the method of moving quadrics.

- title: "GameTheory Package Development in Macaulay2"
  description: >
    Developed the GameTheory package in Macaulay2 to compute totally mixed Nash equilibria using payoff tensors. Contributed to the <a href="https://www.mis.mpg.de/events/series/macaulay2-in-the-sciences">Workshop</a> and development of the package. 
    Here is the official Macaulay2 <a href="https://macaulay2.com/doc/Macaulay2/share/doc/Macaulay2/GameTheory/html/index.html">documentation</a> of the package.

  description: >
    Supervised by <a href="https://profiles.imperial.ac.uk/m.lawn">Dr Marie-Amelie Lawn</a>. 
    Proved Ratner's Measure Classification Theorem and applied it to Margulis' Theorem, creating Python visualisations for ergodic flows and quantitative results. 
    <a href="https://github.com/chenyangzhaoicl/ICL-M2R-Visualisation">See visualisations here.</a> Wrote key sections of the report and created code-based visualisations.
